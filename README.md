# StackPay üí∞

A peer-to-peer multi-token invoicing and recurring payment system built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

StackPay enables freelancers and businesses to create, send, and track crypto invoices with built-in payment enforcement and recurring payment functionality. All transactions are secured by Bitcoin through the Stacks layer. The system supports STX payments with a foundation for future multi-token support.

## Features

- üìÑ **Invoice Creation**: Generate professional invoices with customizable amounts and descriptions
- üîÑ **Recurring Payments**: Set up automated recurring invoices with flexible intervals
- ü™ô **Multi-token Ready**: Foundation for STX and future SIP-10 token support
- üí∏ **Secure Payments**: Direct STX transfers with built-in escrow and fee handling
- üìä **Payment Tracking**: Monitor invoice status and payment history
- ‚è∞ **Due Date Management**: Automatic expiration and overdue detection
- üîí **Access Control**: Creator-only invoice management and cancellation
- ‚ö° **Token Framework**: Admin-controlled framework for future token expansion

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) CLI tool
- STX wallet for testing
- SIP-10 token contracts for multi-token functionality

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stackpay
cd stackpay
```

2. Run contract checks
```bash
clarinet check
```

3. Run tests
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Usage Examples

### STX Invoices

```clarity
;; Create a $100 STX invoice due in 1 week (1008 blocks)
(contract-call? .stackpay create-invoice 
  'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM 
  u100000000 
  u"Web Development Services" 
  u1008 
  none ;; STX payment
  u6   ;; STX decimals
)

;; Create recurring monthly invoice for $50 STX
(contract-call? .stackpay create-recurring-invoice 
  'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM 
  u50000000 
  u"Monthly Consulting" 
  u1008 
  u4032 
  none ;; STX payment
  u6   ;; STX decimals
)

;; Pay invoice #1
(contract-call? .stackpay pay-invoice u1)
```

### Future SIP-10 Token Support

The contract includes the framework for SIP-10 token support:

```clarity
;; Admin can prepare for future token support
(contract-call? .stackpay add-supported-token .future-token)

;; Invoice structure supports token specification
(contract-call? .stackpay create-invoice 
  recipient 
  amount 
  description 
  due-blocks 
  (some .future-token) ;; Future token support
  token-decimals
)
```

### Token Management

```clarity
;; Admin can prepare token whitelist for future expansion
(contract-call? .stackpay add-supported-token .future-token)

;; Remove token from whitelist
(contract-call? .stackpay remove-supported-token .old-token)

;; Check if token is whitelisted
(contract-call? .stackpay is-token-supported .some-token)
```

## Multi-token Framework

StackPay includes a framework for future multi-token support:

- **STX**: Native Stacks token (fully supported)
- **SIP-10 Tokens**: Framework ready for future implementation

### Token Framework Features

- Token contract storage in invoice data structure
- Token decimal precision tracking
- Admin-controlled token whitelist system
- Extensible payment processing architecture

### Current Limitations

- **STX Only**: Current version supports STX payments only
- **SIP-10 Framework**: Data structures ready but implementation pending
- **Future Expansion**: Contract designed for easy SIP-10 integration

## Fee Structure

The contract charges a 0.5% fee on all successful payments to maintain the platform and ensure sustainability. Fees are paid in the same token as the invoice.

## Security Considerations

- All payments are atomic - they either complete fully or revert
- Invoice creators can only cancel their own unpaid invoices
- Recurring payments require explicit calls to prevent unexpected charges
- Built-in validation prevents invalid amounts and self-payments
- Token whitelist prevents unauthorized token usage
- Proper error handling prevents "unchecked data" issues
- All parameters are validated before processing

## Error Codes

- `u100` - Not authorized
- `u101` - Invoice not found
- `u102` - Invoice already paid
- `u103` - Insufficient payment
- `u104` - Invoice expired
- `u105` - Invalid amount
- `u106` - Invalid recipient
- `u107` - Recurring payment not due
- `u108` - Invalid interval
- `u109` - Invalid due blocks
- `u110` - Invalid description
- `u111` - Invalid fee
- `u112` - Invalid token
- `u113` - Token transfer failed
- `u114` - Unsupported token
