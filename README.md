## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) CLI tool
- STX wallet for testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stackpay
cd stackpay
```

2. Run contract checks
```bash
clarinet check
```

3. Run tests
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Usage Example

```clarity
;; Create a $100 STX invoice due in 1 week (1008 blocks)
(contract-call? .stackpay create-invoice 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM u100000000 u"Web Development Services" u1008)

;; Create recurring monthly invoice for $50 STX
(contract-call? .stackpay create-recurring-invoice 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM u50000000 u"Monthly Consulting" u1008 u4032)

;; Pay invoice #1
(contract-call? .stackpay pay-invoice u1)
```

## Fee Structure

The contract charges a 0.5% fee on all successful payments to maintain the platform and ensure sustainability.

## Security Considerations

- All payments are atomic - they either complete fully or revert
- Invoice creators can only cancel their own unpaid invoices
- Recurring payments require explicit calls to prevent unexpected charges
- Built-in validation prevents invalid amounts and self-payments
